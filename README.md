# ByteWriter - A Text Editor PWA

[![Deploy on Render](https://img.shields.io/badge/Deploy-Render-green.svg)](https://bytewriter.onrender.com/)

**Deployed Application**: [ByteWriter on Render](https://bytewriter.onrender.com)  
**GitHub Repository**: [ByteWriter Repo](https://github.com/Robert-Ulloa/ByteWriter)

## Description

ByteWriter is a Progressive Web Application (PWA) text editor designed to function both online and offline. It allows users to create and save notes or code snippets with or without an internet connection, ensuring content is reliably available. ByteWriter meets PWA criteria and leverages IndexedDB to persist data. This project started from a starter code provided by edX Boot Camps LLC, and has been customized and improved to add full PWA capabilities.

The application features:
- A fully functional text editor that saves content to IndexedDB when the user leaves the window.
- The ability to install the application as a desktop icon for quick access.
- A service worker for offline functionality, caching static assets, and efficient loading.
- Compatibility with modern JavaScript features like async/await.
- Deployed on [Render](https://bytewriter.onrender.com) with a fully working backend and client.

## Features

- **Offline functionality**: ByteWriter works seamlessly even without an internet connection.
- **IndexedDB for Data Storage**: Automatically stores user input and retrieves it when the app is reopened.
- **Service Worker**: Uses Workbox to precache static assets, improving load times and enabling offline use.
- **Installable PWA**: ByteWriter can be installed on your desktop or mobile device.
- **Bundled with Webpack**: JavaScript files are bundled using Webpack, and assets like HTML and manifest files are generated.
- **Cross-browser Compatibility**: Fully functional on all modern browsers.
  
## Technologies Used

- **Node.js** - Backend JavaScript runtime.
- **Express.js** - Web server framework.
- **Webpack** - Module bundler.
- **Babel** - Transpiling modern JavaScript.
- **IndexedDB** - Database for local storage.
- **Workbox** - Service worker management for caching and offline support.
- **idb** - A lightweight wrapper for IndexedDB.

## Acceptance Criteria

- The application uses IndexedDB to store user input.
- The application works offline and can be installed as a PWA.
- JavaScript files are bundled using Webpack, and there is a generated service worker and manifest file.
